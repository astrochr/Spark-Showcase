critic_final - Final quality score (0-1)
critic_semantic - Semantic similarity score (0-1)
faiss_total - Total memories in FAISS
memories_stored - Delta memories stored (this interval)
memories_retrieved - Delta memories retrieved (this interval)
cache_hit_rate - Embedding cache efficiency (%)
cache_size - Number of cached embeddings
total_adjustments - Cumulative Dream adjustments
coherence_status - Status category (POOR/FAIR/GOOD/EXCELLENT)
sample_text - Snippet of assistant response

A
Avg drift 0.67 â†’ Moderate creativity (not too stable, not chaos)
Quality 0.58 â†’ Consistent filtering (no garbage in FAISS)
2,787 memories â†’ Robust growth rate
FAIR status 70% â†’ Room for improvement (that's what rolling memory is for!)

âœ… System Stability:

Ran continuously for 12.5 hours without crashes
2,787 memories stored (3.7 memories/minute)
Cache efficiency climbed to 63% (excellent!)

ðŸŽ¯ Performance Metrics:

Avg Drift: 0.67 (oscillating 0.37-0.92)
Avg Quality: 0.58 final, 0.42 semantic
Status: Mostly FAIR (some GOOD, some POOR)
Temperature: Stable at 0.50 (Dream didn't adjust)

ðŸ“ˆ Interesting Patterns:

Drift oscillates but doesn't converge (exploring boundaries)
Quality scores steady around 0.55-0.60 range
Memory growth linear (consistent quality filtering)
No EXCELLENT status achieved (semantic scores holding it back)

1. Quality Gate is RUTHLESS

Only lets 0.60+ final, 0.50+ semantic through
Filters out ~40-50% of responses
What gets through is CONSISTENTLY good

2. Watchdog Cadence is STEADY

Probes every ~30-60 seconds
Generates responses at predictable rate
Quality gate filters at predictable rate
= Linear growth!

3. No Feedback Loop Explosions

System isn't getting "smarter" exponentially (which would curve up)
System isn't degrading (which would curve down)
It's just... working as designed

4. Temperature Stable

0.50 the entire time (Dream didn't intervene)
Consistent generation quality
No random chaos injections

Question Critics Ability so Self Evalute/Critic properly,
